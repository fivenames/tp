## **Design**


### Architecture

<img src="diagrams/architecture-diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.png" alt="Architecture Diagram" width = 300 />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above shows the overall architecture of the LogJob application software. A quick overview of each of the components has been given below.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of [`LogJob`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-T11a-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/logjob/LogJob.java) class) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of LogJob. Responsible for all user interactions between the user and the application.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command parser/executor. Parses, validates, and executes the given command.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

`Util`: Provides classes for use across multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="diagrams/architecture-diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" alt="Architecture Sequence Diagram" width="750" />

> **NOTE**: The sequence diagram above shows a simplified version of the `delete` command execution for clarity purposes

For the two main components `Model` and `Storage` dealing with application state,

* The main components `Logic`, `Model` and `Storage` are defined in interfaces. This allows the implemenetation details of each component to be decoupled from the implementation details.
* The main components `Logic`, `Model` and `Storage` are implemented in `LogicManager`, `ApplictationManager`, and `StorageManager` respectively.

> **EXAMPLE:** The `Storage` component defines its API in the `Storage.java` interface. It implements this interface via the `StorageManager.java` class. Other components interact through this interface rather than a concrete calss to prevent other components being coupled to the implementation. 

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`UiMain.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-T11a-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/logjob/ui/UiMain.java)

Here is a class diagram of the UI component, not all methods and attributes are included to reduce the complexity.
![UML Diagram](diagrams/class-diagrams/UIClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `UiMain` that handles the direct interactions between the user and the program logic.

The `UI` component is called by the ApplicationManager,
* Receive command from the user on the CLI.
* Outputs the list of applications on the CLI.
* Outputs the responses of the program to the user.
* Outputs the error message that is thrown by the program.

The Class UiMain is a Singleton class, and only one instance exists system wide. It is passed to the necessary components as an instance when needed.

The UiMain also calls the methods in the utility class UiTable to generate the table for the list of application.
The getTable() method will return the full string of the application table to the UiMain.

The UiMain also access constants specified in the UiConstants class.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-T11a-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/logjob/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component (Note that individual parser classes are omitted for clarity and represented by the overall `Parser`package):

<img src="diagrams/class-diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="405"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `ApplicationParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. After each execution, the `LogicManager` saves the `Model` state by executing `Storage` methods

Here are the other classes in `Parser` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="diagrams/class-diagrams/ParserClassesDiagram.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ApplicationParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) 
* `XYZCommandParser` uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which is returned back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommand` objects inherit from the abstract `Command` class that defines common methods such as `execute`, `equals`, and `isRunning`.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) implement the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.
* The `ParserUtils` class depends on the `Validator` package to validate each specific field. This ensures user inputs for job title, company name, application status, etc. meet domain constraints before conversion.  

### Model component
**Class** : [`ApplicationManager.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-T11a-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/logjob/model/ApplicationManager.java)

<img src="diagrams/class-diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="800" />


The `Model` component

* Is in charge of storing the working copy of the current Internship Applications in an ArrayList.
- Implements the `InternshipApplication` class which stores relevant data of an application such as its Company Name, Job Title, Status, and Date.
  - Status is implemented using an enumeration `ApplicationStatus` which helps restrict statuses to a few valid values.
* Handles the actual manipulation of data through the `Application Manager` class.
** It recieves the appropriate command and data from the command classes, and executes the relevant methods. 
* Does not depend on any of the other structures of the program, as it's designed to be a black box to manipulate, store and handle data.


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S2-CS2113-T11a-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/logjob/storage/Storage.java)


![Class Diagram of Storage](diagrams/class-diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` component,
* Is implemented by the StorageManager, which reads and writes from the `data.txt` file stored in disk
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)
* It depends on `HashUtil` to generate and verify hashes
* It depends on `ApplicationSerializer` to serialize and deserialize applications into a string format.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
> ❗ **_NOTE:_** The lifeline for the obejcts instantiated should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to the limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

### Add a new internship application
The diagram below illustrates the classes involved and the sequence of method calls involved in processing an `add` command:

![Sequence diagram of add command](diagrams/sequence-diagrams/add-sequence.png)

The `AddCommand` handles the creation of new internship applications from user input. The input string is first passed to `LogicManager`, which delegates parsing responsibility to `ApplicationParser`. The parser recognizes the command type and forwards the input to `AddCommandParser`. This parser extracts the required fields—such as company name, role, status and date—and validates them. If validation succeeds, it passes these fields to `AddCommand` which constructs an `InternshipApplication` with the values.

Next the `AddCommand` interacts with the `Model` to add a new `InternshipApplication` class. If there is an existing application already in the model, the new class is a duplicate and an error is thrown. Otherwise, it is added tp the `Model`. A `CommandResult` that encapsulates command output is returned `LogicManager`, which then uses the `UI` component to output this result to the user.   


### Edit an internship application
The diagram below illustrates the classes involved and the sequence of method calls involved in processing an `edit` command:
![Sequence diagram of edit command](diagrams/sequence-diagrams/edit-sequence.png)

The `EditCommand` is responsible for modifying an existing internship application in the application list. After parsing is completed and the command is instantiated, `EditCommand` proceeds to execute by retrieving the application at the specified index.
During execution, it checks:
* Whether the `index` is valid (within bounds of the application list)
* Whether at least one editable field (e.g., company name, job title, status, date) has been provided

If no field is provided for update, or the provided field is same as the existing, an error is thrown to indicate a no-op command.

To apply the edit, a new `InternshipApplication` object is constructed using the updated values, and this new instance replaces the original application in the model. Before replacement, the model performs a duplicate check—if the new application already exists in the list (based on key fields), the command is rejected as a duplicate.


### Delete an internship application
The diagram below illustrates the classes involved and the sequence of method calls involved in processing an `delete` command:
![Sequence diagram of delete command](diagrams/sequence-diagrams/delete-sequence.png)
### List all internship applications
![Sequence diagram of list command](diagrams/sequence-diagrams/list-sequence.png)

After the input is read and parsed by the parser, the main program calls execute which will then be identified to call the listApplication() method.
The listApplication method calls the printApplications() of the UiMain class, passing in the list of application. UI will do the job of printing the table of applications onto the CLI.

### Sort internship applications by field
![Sequence diagram of sort command](diagrams/sequence-diagrams/sort-sequence.png)

Very similar to the list command, sort command reads and parses the input from the user and execute the sorting on the application list 
and finally automatically calls a printApplications() to print the table of applications (now sorted) onto the CLI.

### Find an internship application

![Sequence diagram of find command](diagrams/sequence-diagrams/find-sequence.png)

`find` command search string will first be parsed by the `FindCommandParser` (which validates for empty inputs, and edge cases). If it passes validation, a `FindCommandObject` is returned.
When the `FindCommand` object is executed, it utilizes the `find(application)` function in the model `ApplicationManager` which will return an `observableList` (a read-only list of `InternshipApplication`).
The result is then stored into a standardized `CommandResult` object, which stores the `findSuccess` output message, and the `observableList`.

`LogicManager` then outputs the returned CommandResult using `UI` printMessage method.

### Help command

![Sequence diagram of help command](diagrams/sequence-diagrams/help-sequence.png)

Similar to the commands described above, the `help` command will first be parsed through the `ApplicationParser`, which creates a `HelpCommandParser` object that ensures that `help` does not have any trailing arguments (as it does not take any arguments).
After which it returns a `HelpCommand` object. When executed, the `HelpCommand` object will return a standardized `CommandResult` object with the `isHelp` attributed set to `true`.

Since the `HelpCommand` is rather output heavy and heavily reliant on various UI constants, it has a dedicated UI method to output help. The `LogicManager` then calls `helpOutput` method of `UI`, which will output the help message to the user. (Note that `help` and `exit` are the ***only*** commands that have dedicated `UI` methods)

### Exit the application
![Sequence diagram of exit command](diagrams/sequence-diagrams/exit-sequence.png)

Similar to the commands above, after being parsed and validated for arguments (`exit` should have none), an `ExitCommand` object is returned. The `ExitCommand` object, when executed, returns a `CommandResult` object, with the `isRunning` attribute set to `false`.
`LogJob` queries `isRunning()` after every command, and after `exit` is processed, it will return false, which will then exit the program (and the instances of `LogJob`, `LogicManager`, `ApplicationParser`, and `UI` will cease to exist and be garbage collected).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Design considerations:**
1. **Clear Separation of Concerns:** When deciding the architecture, we wanted to ensure that the different components of the application are clearly separated. This allows for easier maintenance and development of the application as the team could work on different components simultaneously. For example, the `Logic` component is responsible for parsing and executing commands, while the `Model` component is responsible for managing the data.
2. **Intuitive User Experience:** To make the application user-friendly, we tried to make the commands as intuitive as possible, and even developed a help command to assist users in understanding how to use the application. The commands are designed to be similar to common CLI commands, making it easier for users who are familiar with command line interfaces.
3. **Extensibility:** The architecture is designed to be extensible, allowing for future features to be added without significant changes to the existing codebase. For example, the `Logic` component can easily accommodate new commands by adding new command classes and parsers.

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

Our code is set up so that data persistence is handled by our Storage component. The plan for data archiving is to integrate an extension of this component that allows older data to be serialized and moved into a separate archive file. Essentially, when the application manager updates or cleans up the current data store, the archiving feature would trigger the StorageManager to back up the relevant data (for example, in JSON format) and move it to an archive file. This modular approach ensures that data archiving is added without major changes to the existing persistence logic.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of internship applications
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: manage internship applications faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app
