## Features

### Adding an application: `add`
Adds a new Internship Application into the list

Format `add -n [COMPANY NAME] -j [JOB TITLE] -s [APPLICATION STATUS] -d[DATE]`

Example of usage:
`add -n Goggle -j SWE -s INTERVIEW -d 2025-01-01`

**üìåNote** that `-s` and `-d` flags are optional, if blank, will default to `APPLIED` and `Today's date`<br>

Both **Company Name** (`-n`) and **Job Title** (`-j`) must:
- Be **non-empty**
- Contain only **alphanumeric characters** and **allowed special symbols**:  
  `& , - . ' / ( ) ~ ! @ # $ % ^ * _ + = ?`
- Be at most **50 characters long**

‚ùó Input exceeding this limit or using unsupported characters will result in an error.


Here is a list of possible status accepted by the application:
> applied [0]<br>
> interview [1]<br>
> rejected [2] <br>
> offered [3]<br>
> accepted [4] <br>
> rejected_offer [5] <br>

üí° The status is case-insensitive. Note that the statuses can be input as numbers from 0 to 5, or as the full name of the status (without the number). The status numbers associated with the status are indicated as the square brackets in the table above.

‚ùóTo include the date of application, follow the format: `YYYY-MM-DD` as shown in the example.

‚ö†Ô∏è Duplicate Detection: A job application is considered a duplicate if all of its fields match an existing entry.

‚ùå Commands that add duplicate applications will be rejected and trigger an error message.

### Editing an application: `edit`
Edits an existing Internship Application on the list at position INDEX

Format `edit INDEX [-n COMPANY NAME] [-j JOB TITLE] [-s APPLICATION STATUS] [-d DATE]`

Example of usage:
`edit 1 -s OFFERED -d 2025-04-01`

**üìåNote** that INDEX has to be an integer from `1` to `n`, where `n`  is the total number of applications.
Edit must also contain at least one flag.

‚ö†Ô∏è No-Operation Detection: If the input arguments exactly match the fields of the existing Internship Application, it is consider as a No-Operation.

‚ùå No-Operation commands are ignored and trigger a warning message.

‚ö†Ô∏è Duplicate Detection: If an application is edited such that all of its fields match an existing entry, it is consider duplicate.

‚ùå Commands that produce duplicate edits will be rejected and trigger an error message.

üí° Sorting by name of company is case-insensitive.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?

**A**: `data.txt` is the data file for LogJob, found in the same directory as `LogJob.jar`.
If moving data between different locations/computers is needed, the `data.txt` can be simply copied over to the target destination.

**Q**: How do I save my data?

**A**: No need to manually save your data! LogJob will automatically save your data to your computer whenever you exit the application.

**Q**: Must I create my own data.txt?

**A**: No! You do not have to create your own data.txt! LogJob will create one for you one does not exist!

**Q**: Can I manually change data.txt?

**A**: No! LogJob values data integrity, therefore it will reject your changes to data.txt!

## Known Issues

1. When the terminal window is not large enough to display the whole row of application, the row will be wrapped around by the terminal, this is due to the limitation of Command Line Interface.<br>
![issue](images/knownIssue.png)
Try to enlarge or full screen the terminal when encountering such issue, refrain from adding company names or job titles that are too long.
